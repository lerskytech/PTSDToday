# PTSD Today - A Trauma-Informed Resource Platform

This repository contains the source code for PTSD Today, a web-based platform designed to provide accessible, trauma-informed resources for individuals affected by PTSD.

## About The Project

PTSD Today is built with React and Tailwind CSS, focusing on a clean, calming, and user-friendly interface. Our goal is to create a safe and supportive digital space where users can find information, tools, and community to support their healing journey.

### Core Features

*   **PTSD Self-Assessment:** An interactive, multi-step questionnaire to help users privately assess their symptoms.
*   **Healing Tools:** A collection of guided, interactive exercises designed to provide immediate support. The first tool is a **Guided Breathing Exercise**.
*   **Education Hub:** Curated articles and resources about PTSD, trauma, and recovery.
*   **Community & Stories:** A space for users to connect and share their experiences (planned feature).
